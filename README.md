Turning Coffee Sales Dataset into a Dashboard for visualization

Data was extracted from an online source which included data for countries USA, Ireland and UK.

The data included Customer Information, Product type, Country and the sale contributed.

The process included various steps ranging from data preprocessing, cleansing, transformation and its conversion to visualization.

The dashboard created includes various slicers based on certain parameters.

This will help any nonexpert to extract insights about coffee sales and its trends.

Hope you like my work :D
